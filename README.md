# DFO-frontend

To install dependencies, write `npm install` in terminal. Then run the app by running `npm run`.

To open storybook, run `npm start storybook`.

## :clipboard: Rules

- All styles are written with SCSS (SASS)
- Follow the airbnb-sass-styleguide: https://github.com/airbnb/css
- Use the BEM methodology: http://getbem.com/
- All of the React-components has to be functional components (no state), because we will only be using the rendered markup.
- Follow the WCAG 2.0 guidelines, with DIFI's modifications: https://uu.difi.no/krav-og-regelverk/wcag-20-standarden

## Background

This project was originally scaffolded with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) was added afterwards.
